# OmniChain - efficient self-updating visual workflows for large language models - build automations, chatbots, agents, and integrate with existing frameworks

![Screenshot](/screenshot.png)

-   Build powerful custom workflows with AI language models doing all the heavy lifting, guided by your own logic process, for a drastic improvement in efficiency.

-   Use the chain's memory abilities to store and recall information, and make decisions based on that information.

-   Easily make workflows that act like tireless robot employees, doing tasks 24/7 and pausing only when you decide to talk to them, without ceasing operation.

-   Squeeze more power out of smaller models by guiding them through a specific process, like a train on rails, even giving them hints along the way, resulting in much more efficient and cost-friendly logic.

-   Access the underlying operating system to read/write files, and run commands.

-   Have the model generate and run NodeJS code snippets, or even entire scripts, to use APIs, automate tasks, and more, harnessing the full power of your system.

-   Create custom agents and regular logic chains wired up together in a single workflow to create efficient and flexible automations.

-   Attach your creations to any existing framework (agentic or otherwise) via the OpenAI-format API, to empower and control its thought processes better than ever!

-   Private (self-hosted), fully open-source, and available for commercial use via the non-restrictive MIT license.

-   No coding skills required!
